# 3D Portfolio Project

Welcome to my 3D Portfolio Project! This project showcases my skills and creativity in web development using cutting-edge technologies to create an interactive and visually appealing portfolio.

## Technologies Used

### Three.js

[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of 3D graphics on the web. It allows me to create complex and visually stunning 3D scenes, animations, and interactive elements that bring my portfolio to life. With Three.js, I can render 3D objects, apply textures, lighting, and shadows, making the portfolio dynamic and engaging.

### React 3D Fiber

[React 3D Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) is a React renderer for Three.js. It enables me to use React's declarative approach to build 3D scenes, making the integration of 3D graphics into a React application seamless and efficient. By leveraging React 3D Fiber, I can manage the state of my 3D components, handle user interactions, and create reusable 3D components, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the project.

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes to build responsive and modern user interfaces quickly. Tailwind allows me to style my portfolio efficiently with its highly customizable utility classes. By using Tailwind, I can ensure that the portfolio is not only aesthetically pleasing but also responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

### Framer Motion

[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is a powerful library for creating animations and gestures in React. It allows me to add smooth and fluid animations to my portfolio, enhancing the user experience. With Framer Motion, I can animate elements on the page, create interactive transitions, and bring my 3D components to life with motion. This library helps me to make the portfolio more engaging and interactive.

### EMAILjs

[EMAILjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) is a service that allows me to send emails directly from the client-side JavaScript without needing a server. It simplifies the process of handling form submissions and contact forms in my portfolio. By integrating EMAILjs, visitors can easily send me messages or inquiries directly through the portfolio, improving communication and accessibility.

## Project Features

- **3D Graphics and Animations**: Utilizing Three.js and React 3D Fiber, the portfolio features interactive 3D models, animations, and scenes.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS, the portfolio is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion adds fluid animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
- **Contact Form**: Integrated with EMAILjs, the portfolio includes a contact form for easy communication.

## Getting Started
